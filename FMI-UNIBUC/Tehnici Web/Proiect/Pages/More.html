        We display photos of listings, host profiles, and reviews to help you make informed decisions when considering a host's space. We've also created search filters so you can narrow your results by type of accommodation, price, and location. For example, if you're looking to make friends and stay with a host, select Private Room or Shared Room. Or if you're looking for an entire space to call your own, go ahead and select the Entire Place filter.

        The host has the option to either accept or decline the request, or ask you questions about your trip. When a host responds to your request, we send you an email to let you know. If they don't respond within 24 hours, your request simply expires. The Instant Book button immediately confirms your reservation and closes the host's calendar to other incoming requests. We send you a receipt by email with your trip's details, and your host may follow up with you, too.

        From futons on the floor to castles on the hilltop, each listings is unique. Search results feature entire homes, private rooms, and shared rooms at every price point. Hosts describe their space in detail, including available amenities and arrival and departure times, and guests leave reviews about their experience.

        We help make sharing easy, enjoyable, and safe. We verify personal profiles and listings, maintain a smart messaging system so hosts and guests can communicate with certainty, and manage a trusted platform to collect and transfer payments.
